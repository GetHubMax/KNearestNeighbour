# KNearestNeighbour
<p> By Max Walker</p>
<p>
This is a generic implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors classification machine learning algorithm.
</p>
<p><b> Program input </b><p>
  <ul>
  <li>one file will use leave one out.</li>
  <li>two files will use KNN.</li>
  <li>three files will use KNN, with the third being a datadump.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file format used is X doubles/floats with a single string at the end of the line. 
X being the number of doubles/floats read before the first string on the first line read by the progam.
Basicly it use the first line modle the rest. 
The doubles/floats will make up the attributes of the subject and the string will be the label</p>
<p>


Things to do:
  <ul>
  <li>Update to Java 8</li>
  <li>Use Streams to sort wrappers</li>
  <li>Make a user interface with more control</li>
  <ul>
</p>
